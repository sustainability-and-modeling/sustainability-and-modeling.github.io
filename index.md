## What is SusMod?

Sustainability is becoming a key characteristic of modern systems. While this trend has been long recognized, rigorous formal methods for assessing sustainability, reasoning about often contradicting sustainability properties, and involving the human in this process are missing.
SusMod, the International Workshop on <b>Sus</b>tainability and <b>Mod</b>eling, aims to unearth visceral links between sustainability and MDE, and that, in both directions: MDE in support of sustainable systems engineering, and sustainability of MDE techniques.

## Who is SusMod for?

The workshop is intended for a wide spectrum of professionals working on various aspects of sustainability <i>by</i> MDE or sustainability <i>of</i> MDE.
We anticipate academic researchers and industrial practitioners to attend the workshop.
