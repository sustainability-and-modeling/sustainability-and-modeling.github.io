<span style="color:red;">TBA</span>


<!--

\subsection{Topics of interest}

The topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,noitemsep]
    \item MDE \textit{for} sustainability
    \begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,noitemsep]
        \item Modeling languages, formalisms, and methods to tackle the complexity of sustainability through the mechanism of abstraction;
        \item Code generation and model interpretation for sustainability metrics;
        \item Multi-paradigm, multi-view, and multi-level modeling for sustainability;
        \item Collaborative modeling for sustainability.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Sustainability \textit{of} MDE
    \begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,noitemsep]
        \item Technical sustainability, e.g., driven by model evolution, model-based reconfiguration;
        \item Environmental sustainability, e.g., energy-efficiency of model transformation, self-adaptation for minimized environmental footprint;
        \item Economic sustainability, e.g., reuse and re-purposing of models;
        \item Social sustainability, e.g., inclusive modeling practices, participatory modeling in diverse environments, human factors in modeling.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Digitalization for sustainability: smart systems, digital twins, twin transition, cyber-physical social systems, intelligent ecosystems.

    \item Organizational aspects, maturity models, and lifecycle models, synergies between circular economy and systems engineering.

    \item Applications, case studies, tools, industry reports, patterns and catalogs.
    
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Intended paper format}

We solicit the following types of papers.
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt, noitemsep]
    \item[1.] \textit{Full research papers} (max. 10 pages): novel research contributions.
    \item[2.] \textit{Short papers} (max. 5 pages), including (a) \textit{Work in progress}: preliminary results; (b) \textit{Vision papers}: new visions and strategic ideas; (c) \textit{Case papers}: description of real-life sustainability problems.
\end{itemize}




SUBMISSION


PROCEEDINGS


## **Submissions**

We invite the following three types of submissions.

**Regular workshop papers** (up to 10 pages) reporting on fundational results in collaborative model-driven software engineering.

**Vision papers** (5 pages) presenting innovative ideas.

**Case papers** (up to 10 pages) elaborating on a collaborative case, and demonstrating its solution via a tool of choice with the intent to conduct a hands-on session and report the results. Case papers will be reviewed and published as a regular paper in the proceedings. The description of the case should follow the instructions outlined in the [Case paper â€“ Detailed instructions](#case-paper--detailed-instructions) section below. After the workshop, experimenting teams are encouraged to report their results and data to facilitate a joint publication of results. See the [Joint publication](#joint-publication) section below.

**Protocols** (up to 10 pages) defining protocols for empirical evaluation of a tool with no intent to conduct a hands-on session. Protocols will be reviewed and published in the proceedings as the RR1 part of a [registered report](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/Supplements/RegisteredReports.md).


## **Presentations**
Authors of each accepted paper will be invited to give a *regular* talk. <br/>
Protocol authors will be invited to give a talk about their initial results if applicable, and to demonstrate the protocol during their talk.



## **Proceedings**

All submitted papers must adhere to the [IEEE Conference](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) format, and submitted electronically through the [HoWCoM EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=howcom2023) web page.
An [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn) is also available.
All submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee. Authors of case papers should expect a particularly detailed feedback to allow them to leverage the opportunity the workshop provides to the fullest extent.
All accepted papers will be published in the MODELS Companion proceedings and the workshop website.

To be published in the proceedings, at least one author of accepted papers must present their work at the workshop. Authors of accepted case papers commit to conduct a hands-on session for their tool during the afternoon session.
