# Call for Papers


### **Topics of interest**

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- MDE *for* sustainability
  - Modeling languages, formalisms, and methods to tackle the complexity of sustainability through the mechanism of abstraction;
  - Digital twins for sustainability
  - Multi-paradigm, multi-view, and multi-level modeling for sustainability;
  - Collaborative modeling for sustainability
- Sustainability *of* MDE
  - Technical sustainability, e.g., driven by model evolution, model-based reconfiguration;
  - Environmental sustainability, e.g., energy-efficiency of model transformation, self-adaptation for minimized environmental footprint;
  - Economic sustainability, e.g., reuse and re-purposing of models;
  - Social sustainability, e.g., inclusive modeling practices, participatory modeling in diverse environments, human factors in modeling.


### **Paper format**

We solicit the following types of papers.
- *Full research papers* (max. 10 pages): novel research contributions.
- *Short papers* (max. 5 pages), including (a) *Work in progress*: preliminary results; (b) *Vision papers*: new visions and strategic ideas; (c) *Case papers*: description of real-life sustainability problems.

Note: **page limits include references**!

All submitted papers must adhere to the [ACM Conference](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) format.

LaTeX users must use the provided acmart.cls and ACM-Reference-Format.bst without modification, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e., \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}), and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e., \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}). The review option adds line numbers, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments.

### **Submission**
Manuscripts are to be submitted electronically through the [SusMod EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=susmod2024) web page.
All submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee. 

### **Presentations**
Authors of each accepted paper will be invited to give a *regular* talk.

### **Proceedings**
Accepted papers are intended to be published in the [MODELS](https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2024) Companion proceedings and the workshop website. To be published in the proceedings, at least one author of accepted papers must present their work at the workshop.

#### **General regulations**

- By submitting to SusMod, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. In particular, papers submitted to SusMod must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration for SusMod.

- By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

- Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2024. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
