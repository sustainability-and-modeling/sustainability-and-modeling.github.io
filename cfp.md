# Call for Papers


### **Topics of interest**

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- MDE *for* sustainability
  - Modeling languages, formalisms, and methods to tackle the complexity of sustainability through the mechanism of abstraction;
  - Code generation and model interpretation for sustainability metrics;
  - Multi-paradigm, multi-view, and multi-level modeling for sustainability;
  - Collaborative modeling for sustainability
- Sustainability *of* MDE
  - Technical sustainability, e.g., driven by model evolution, model-based reconfiguration;
  - Environmental sustainability, e.g., energy-efficiency of model transformation, self-adaptation for minimized environmental footprint;
  - Economic sustainability, e.g., reuse and re-purposing of models;
  - Social sustainability, e.g., inclusive modeling practices, participatory modeling in diverse environments, human factors in modeling.


### **Paper format**

We solicit the following types of papers.
- *Full research papers* (max. 10 pages): novel research contributions.
- *Short papers* (max. 5 pages), including (a) *Work in progress*: preliminary results; (b) *Vision papers*: new visions and strategic ideas; (c) *Case papers*: description of real-life sustainability problems.

All submitted papers must adhere to the [ACM Conference](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) format.

LaTeX users must use the provided acmart.cls and ACM-Reference-Format.bst without modification, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e., \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}), and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e., \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}). The review option adds line numbers, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments.

### **Submission**
Manuscripts are to be submitted electronically through the [SusMod EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=susmod2024) web page.
All submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee. 

### **Presentations**
Authors of each accepted paper will be invited to give a *regular* talk.

### **Proceedings**
Accepted papers are intended to be published in the MODELS Companion proceedings and the workshop website. To be published in the proceedings, at least one author of accepted papers must present their work at the workshop.
